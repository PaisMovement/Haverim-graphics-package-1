FOR FACEBOOK:
Two versions of a Facebook Cover image, each of the two have a different tagline to pick from.
These should be used as your Facebook Cover Images for a while.

PINTEREST STYLE IMAGE
Not necessarily to be used on Pinterest but just a nice tall ad that can be used on any blog or web page or an email you send a friend or group. These also have the two different tag lines to pick from.

QUICK RESPONSE CODES:
Four QR code images that when scanned by a smart phone with a scan app will open up links
so they can purchase it or bookmark it. You can post these to a blog post or get them on a printed flyer or an email you send a friend or group. I made them in two sizes for flexibility being that QR codes should not be stretched to large or small

POSTER FOR PRINTING:
This is a small 11x17 poster full color. I feel this might be a great resource when placed in the proper place. Get these printed out and pin them up anywhere you can. They have the QR codes on them so they can convert the viewer to a buyer. They also have two different taglines.
