Rediscover the Four Ancient Methods of Bible Study
Did you realize that Jesusâ€™ style of teaching was fundamentality different from contemporary Christian Bible study? Yet the means by which Jesus understood and unpacked the scriptures are completely relevant today. More than that, His rabbinical style of communication, comprised of four levels, is essential for engaging believers and non-believers alike.
By transferring the four lost methods of study into a modern format, Pais Global Director Paul Gibbs developed what has become known as Haverim DevotionsTM. This fresh approach to the ancient way is now occurring in small groups all around the world, connecting people to God through His Word . . . and helping them connect others.
Delving into the why, what, and how of each level, this book equips you to launch your own group study using Haverim DevotionsTM.
This is not a list of steps to execute but an invitation to come and experience. 
This is not a presentation tool but a participation tool.This is not about providing the right answers but provoking the right questions. 
This is not about consuming knowledge but connecting with others to share it.
It is as the ancient Hebrews once referred to it . . . Haverim.
